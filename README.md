## Developer notes:
***I recommend using Pinghack on small server with under 40 members
Pinghack never works on servers with high moderation.***
    
***The command stealpfp can get your account locked for suspicious activity. To unlock it you must add your phonenumber to prevent it from happening in the future...***
    
***Remember to have common sense while using this selfbot. For example don't tell everyone that you are using a selfbot. Your account may get temporarily locked for suspicious activity.***

***I must say that using selfbots is against Discord Terms Of Service blablablabla***
